# StemPGA
Last night I hacked up my first FPGA. I've been struggling to explain to myself why I think FPGAa are such a big deal. Bottom line is: FPGAs are the only gizmos out there than can do to Computers what Computers have been doing to everything else i.e., replace it or reinvent it.
There is also an analogy with Stem Cells in biology. Stem cells can morph into any mature adult cell in your body (hair, skin, bone, muscle, soft tissue, all your internal organs, etc.). FPGAa can morph into any digital logic circuit. And then there is the much hyped acronymization of the over arching discipline (STEM. Science, Technology, Engineering, Math). There is much puntendedness (pun intended) here, but here I'll be posting code to layout an easily replicable, extensible architecture using a Logi-Bone for prototypes.
